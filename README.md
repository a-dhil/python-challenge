# python-challenge
In this assignment there were two csv files about financial record of the company data and poll data of a small town. I have to create python code to analyze the data and print desired output on the terminal and text file.
Before I began working on this assignmnet I reviewed zoom class recordings and was are which python tools are required to achieve the end results.
I looked at hints and consideration section and I know instantly that i will be using list and dictionaries in this assginment.
In class we made the repository with name "python-challenge" and added two more folders named "PyBank" and "PyPoll" in the repository. 
Both PyBank and PyPoll have same folder structure each containing:-
                    Analysis folder which store text file under name analysis.txt
                    Resources folder this has the csv data that was provided to analyse in .csv format
                    Lastly there is python file with name "main.py" that has the python code 
This is the link to my repository:
                https://github.com/a-dhil/python-challenge
            
I started writing the code with the help of in class activities on how to read and write csv files using python code.
Then I began anaysis process to calculate total using for loop and printintg it.
I was able to calculte the "Profit/Loss" for entire period.
I struggled finding the change in "Profit/Loss", I reached out to study group and Jorge Nardy my clasmate helped me with that part of the code plus how to use min and max functions to get greatest increase and decrease. He explained very well and it was very helpful.

After finishing this part i moved on to second part where i had to analyze poll data.
I copied the code form PyBank and had the basic structure to begin with.
Calculating total vote was easy.
I was sure that i will be using dictionary here. Because I have key value pair. Then I initialize the dictionary and was sure what to do next.
Here ChatGPT was helpful I entered the code and instructed it in small parts with what exactly i was looking for.
Once I get the output then i verfy if we had covered that topic in class and what google says about it. 
I was aware about compherhension and asked chatGPT if we can solve this problem with dictionary comprehension then it gave me the revised code.
After my code was running on terminal. I worked on the last part which was to export the files with result in text mode.
I knew how to do this and ChatGPT was there to help when i got struck. 
In the end I reviewed all my code and edited the original comments and gave it detailed comments to remember everything.
